#assigning value to variables

x = 25          # integer type .  No need for semicolon at the end of each statement 
y = 50.25       # floating type
name = "codex"  # string type

print (x)
print (y)
print (name)

# to know which data type the variables are use predefined function type()
# print (type(variable_name))

print ("variable x is",type(x))
print ("variable y is",type(y))
print ("variable name is",type(name))
