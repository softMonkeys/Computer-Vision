# diving into loops

# for loop:

# In the loop below, the range of x will be from 1 to 10 . The value will start from 1 and continue 9
for x in range(1, 10):
    print(x)

print("\n\n")

# In the loop below the value will start from 1 and will continue to 10 but the after each iteration the value will
# be increased by 2
for x in range(1, 10, 2):

# Traversing a list using for loop:

for i in list:
    print(i)

# while loop:

while i > 0:
    print(i)
    i -= 1
