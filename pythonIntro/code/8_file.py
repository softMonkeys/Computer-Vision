# Diving into file handling

# This will help in reading, writting, appending a file.

'''
 Syntax:
 
file_object_variable_name = open("file_name" , "access_mode")

file_object_variable_name : This the variable name you want to give through which you can do operations on the file.
file_name: The name of the file you want to edit/read
access_mode : the mode in which you want to open the file. The basic modes are:
    r  : Opens a file for reading only.
    w  : Opens a file for writing only.
    a  : Opens a file for appending.
    a+ : Opens a file for both appending and reading.
    r+ : Opens a file for both reading and writing. 
    w+ : Opens a file for both writing and reading.
